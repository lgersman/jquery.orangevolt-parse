* add kind of CSS3 selector support to ast find asts containing special children and so on

	supported selectors : 
	- CLASS selector ('.mytoken' will find all asts with rule.token=='mytoken'
	- TAG selector ('Oneof') will find all asts with rule.type=='OneOf'
	- support for CSS >child (direct children), closest (like in jquery) and so on   
	
	example : 
		...
		ast.find( '.mytoken, ZeroOrMore).each( function() {
			...
		}); 
		...
